% Templated languages
One method of auto generation of parameterized hardware relies on templated languages.
AHDW \cite{zhao2023automatic} is a language building upon Verilog with custom syntax for parameterized hardware.
% PyTV's advantage

Different from other domain-specific languages (DSLs) for hardware generation,
PyTV provides users with more control over the hardware architecture and implementation details.
